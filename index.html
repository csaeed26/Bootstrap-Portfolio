            <p>My name is Craig Saeed, I am originally from Chicago, IL. My goal or reason for taking this course is to
                relaunch my career as a developer. Having worked as a front end developer for many years and not
                continuing to train and upgrade my skills, I killed my career as a web developer. I was laid off earlier
                this year and quickly realized I needed training if I ever planned to work as a web developer ever
                again. </p>

            <p>Hopefully, by doing these things I am able to return to work and better support my family. Losing my job
                was a mental knockout and these last seven months have really brought me to a true humbling place in my
                life. I have learned that in order to be successful you must <em>"Bullet-Proof"</em> your
                career. The little things count, the networking, coder sites &amp; blogs, the conventions etc, all
                matter. If I could speak to any aspiring developer my biggest advise would to "stay hungry, learn as
                much as you can for as long as you can".</p>
